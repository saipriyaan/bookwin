            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

            The Parents Den <bold> "AKA Mainstream Values" </bold> is a character building and reinforcing book of values. My purpose for recording this random selection of useful values and positive thoughts is to help inspire, stimulate and guide readers in ways that might help them and future generations.
            
            Readers will also  most likely notice that I have provided several reoccurring themes that have stated in slightly different ways. These themes are most likely the ones that felt were particularly useful.
                                                                                                               Below are a few example for parents to go over with there child.

            1) Be Honest
    <br>
            
            2) Learn to appreciate the things that you already have; because in many cases , you already have the things you really need.
    <br>       
            3) Protect and guard your good name and reputation. They will follow you. So do not let them haunt you. They should be your friends not your enemies.
    <br>        
            4) Talk is cheap. Action is better
        <br>    
            5) Be a community asset, not a liability .
          <br>  
            6) Learn to discipline your self so that other will not have to do it for you.
     <br>       
            7) Knowledge is power
            
         <br>                          
                       Parents should go over the values  and allow the child to explain them! This is one of the best decision parent workshop between a parent and their children.
